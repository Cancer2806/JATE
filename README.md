## Installation Notes  

  Copy from Github and maintain folder structure.  Open to the folder and use NPM to install the dependencies.  Once complete, you can type npm run start to open the applicationto the local server.   


## Usage 

  Project is deployed to Heroku.  Navigate to the deployment at https://jate021.herokuapp.com/   

  From there, it is extremely intuitive, simply type in anything that you want to remember and it will be saved when the editor loses focus.  Data will persist as it is saved to the Browsers indexDB and can save to local storage as a backup.

  The application will run even when not connected to the internet.

  The application can also be downloaded (by pressing the Install button).  It will place an icon on the desktop and operate as a stand alone application, outside of the browser.
